To operate my finalProject.m file, simply run the program to pop up the
user interface. Input the unfactored loads into their respective textboxes
making sure that your units are uniform. Make sure that there are 0's in 
the fields that you aren't editing, and click the pushbutton when you are 
ready for the program to determine the max factored load.

If you want to determined the moment at specific location on a uniformly
loaded and simply supported beam, fill in the field for location on the
beam (X) and the length of the beam (L). X is the distance from the left
side of the beam. The max factored load needs to still be saved into the
user interface. If it is, click the pushbutton to determine the moment
load.
